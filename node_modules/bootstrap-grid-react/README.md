This is a simple collection of React components that mirror Bootstrap grid system: <Container>, <Row> and <Column>, to be used with Node.JS.

The module precompiles JSX to JS, but two extra steps are required for this to work:
- include Bootstrap in your project - [you only need the grid](#user-content-bootstrap-css-file);
- [bundle up your files](#user-content-browserify-bundle) with something like Browserify.

### Why another grid for React?
I needed a grid system and couldn’t find a good alternative to Bootstrap. Similar modules already exist but couldn’t honestly get them to work.I was also playing around with material-ui and didn’t feel like including the whole react-bootstrap module just for their grid.

In short, use this:
- if you just want a simple grid system;
- if you don’t want to use react-bootstrap for your whole project.

Don’t use this if react-bootstrap is already included in your project, their grid system didn’t use to be included but it is now.

### How to use
Simply install it with npm and then require it in your project, for example:
```javascript
var Grid = require(‘react-grid’);
var Container = Container;
var Row = Grid.Row;
var Col = Grid.Column;

<Container fluid={true}>
  <Row>
    <Col
      lg={6}
      lgOffset={2}
      md={6}
      sm={12}
      xs={12}>
    </Col>
  </Row>
</Container>
```
You can pass custom classes to both Row and Column. Full example [here](https://github.com/Ericat/react-grid-example/blob/master/client/react/app.jsx).

#### Browserify bundle
Your file(s) will need to go through something like Browserify to allow the use of “require” on the front-end: you can see [this example](https://github.com/Ericat/react-grid-example) that handles the build with a Gulp task. Chances are that you will already have one in place if you use React with Node.JS, but feel free to check out the example above.

#### Bootstrap CSS file
In the example above you will find a [config.json](https://github.com/Ericat/react-grid-example/blob/master/config.json)
 that you can upload to Bootstrap at http://getbootstrap.com/customize/ to get a custom version that only includes the grid system.
You can also copy it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ericat/react-grid-example/master/public/lib/css/bootstrap.min.css).
